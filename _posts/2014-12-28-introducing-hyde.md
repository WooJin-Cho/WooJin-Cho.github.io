I am a M.S. student advised by [Prof.Noseong Park](https://sites.google.com/view/noseong)  [(Bigdata Analytics Lab)](https://sites.google.com/view/npark/home) in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/). My primary research areas include scientific machine learning and implicit neural representations (INR). Additionally, I have an interest in deep learning frameworks based on meta-learning network pruning and data compression method. In the future, I aspire to research related to simulation techniques by combining numerical analysis methods with scientific ML technologies (e.g., Physics-informed neural networks, Neural operator, etc.). I have a goal to build an artificial intelligence that can be interpreted mathematically and statistically. 
**I greatly enjoy collaborating with researchers who share similar interests. If you are interested in my research areas or would like to collaborate, please feel free to contact me! ([snowmoon@yonsei.ac.kr](mailto:snowmoon@yonsei.ac.kr))**
